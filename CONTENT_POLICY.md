# Content Policy

## What this project is

Alex Cyber Study is a free, independent study tool built to help candidates learn
information security concepts across the eight CISSP domains. It is not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or sponsored by ISC2®. CISSP® is a registered trademark of ISC2.

## Origin of all questions

Every question in this bank is **original content**, written from scratch by the
project author. No questions were sourced from, derived from, or based on any actual
CISSP exam sitting. The author has not reproduced, transcribed, or paraphrased any
live or retired exam item.

All questions are grounded in publicly available standards and frameworks, including:

- NIST Special Publications (public domain, US government works)
- IETF RFCs (open standards)
- ISO/IEC 27001, 27002, 22301 (referenced conceptually)
- ISC2 CISSP Exam Outline 2024 (publicly published by ISC2)
- ISC2 Code of Ethics (publicly published by ISC2)
- GDPR (EU law, publicly available)
- PCI DSS (publicly published by PCI SSC)
- ISACA COBIT (publicly available framework)
- AICPA Trust Services Criteria (publicly available)

Every item in the question bank carries a `sourceIds` field linking it to one or more
of these public sources. This is verifiable directly in `cat/question-bank.sample.json`.

## ISC2 Code of Ethics

This project does not violate the ISC2 Code of Ethics. Specifically:

- No actual exam questions have been shared or reproduced (no NDA breach)
- The project advances the profession by making quality study material freely available
- The project is clearly labelled as an independent, non-official study aid
- No candidate is misled into believing this tool is an official ISC2 product

Creating original educational content about publicly documented exam domains is
consistent with ISC2's own stated mission of "inspiring a safe and secure cyber world"
and supporting the growth of the profession.
