# Content Policy

This project publishes original practice content built from public standards concepts.

## Rules

1. Do not import or transform third-party commercial question banks.
2. Use concept-level references from open/public sources only.
3. Keep `sourceIds` on every question item.
4. Block proprietary markers in stems/choices/explanations.
5. Keep a visible non-affiliation disclaimer for certification brands.

## Open-Source Pipeline
